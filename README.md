### 90753 Spatial Data Science with ArcGIS Pro process log

## About me 

I'm Claire and I’m in the final months of my Public Policy and Management degree at Carnegie Mellon University. My work focuses on policy solutions that drive equity and economic development, with a particular interest in rural communities, environmental justice, and emerging technologies like AI.

Before coming to CMU, I lived in Denver, Boston, Walla Walla, Seoul, and Cordova, experiences that have shaped my perspective on policy challenges across different regions and cultures. My most recent job before graduate school was as a commercial fisherman, where I developed a deep appreciation for industries that sustain local economies. Currently, I'm researching AI-driven disparities in healthcare access and outcomes between rural and urban communities. 

## What I hope to learn 

In this course, I’m excited to refine my GIS skills and apply them to an independent project. I am particularly hopeful to use this class for my capstone project, where I’m working with the Center for Rural Pennsylvania to analyze youth retention and population loss in rural communities. My research focuses on mobile connectivity and workforce development, with the goal of identifying strategies to support long-term community sustainability. Through this course, I hope to explore some of the spatial questions that will shape our final recommendations.

As for what comes next, I don’t have a job lined up yet, nor am I tied to a specific path forward. My passions lie broadly in helping underserved communities and tackling complex policy challenges. That being said, after graduation, I plan to spend a couple of months in South America, improving my Spanish communication skills and gaining new perspectives before deciding on my next steps.
